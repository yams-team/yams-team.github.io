# Yet another multiplayer server <img style="width:1.5em" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yams-team/.github/main/logo.svg" />

This is a full reimplementation of the original Minecraft multiplayer server. This is a education project, you are free to use it at your own risk.

This server consists of multiple microservices, each of which is responsible for a specific part of the server.

**The project is currently in development.**
